It's been a while and it's still a frustration to see that there's none yet of a cms built on node.js
<!--more-->
Apparently the one that we are asking for is simple:

1) CRUD capabilities

2) Able to write to a database

3) Has Authentication features

I have surfaced among many tutorials and examples over the web:

4) howtonode's blog

5) nodetuts products

6) calipso's cms

7) qed's demo

But I haven't still gotten hold of a software that I could really depend on. So I decided to take on a quest,

to produce it myself. I plan to combine the user authentication of products' and demo's. Here's what I'll

come up with:

8) Dissect how user authentication of products' using Mongoose works.

9) Dissect how CRUD of demo's works.
